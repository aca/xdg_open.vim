*xdg_open.txt* Run xdg-open from Vim; re-implements netrw's gx.

INTRODUCTION                                                        *xdg_open*

Re-implements netrw's |gx| command with a call to {xdg-open} (or a similar
tool of your choosing).

This is especially useful if you're using dirvish or some other file-manager
other than netrw.

Is this fully compatible with netrw? ~
It should be for most purposes, but feature-for-feature (or bug-for-bug)
compatibility was not a primary goal. Notable changes are:

- We just try to run {xdg-open}. No tricks and complicated fallbacks if that
  fails.

- The default is to get the <cWORD> instead of <cfile>. This works better with
  urls which have query parameters.

- The shell command is run in the background. This is much more sane.

Can I disable netrw completely? ~
- To only disable gx-related functionality: >
  let g:netrw_nogx = 1
<
- To disable all of netrw: >
  let g:loaded_netrw = 1
<
- To disable the netrw doc files you need to remove the doc file at 
  *$VIMRUNTIME/doc/pi_netrw.txt* and rebuild the help tags with: >
  :helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc
<
  This has the advantage of not cluttering |:helpgrep| or tab completion.
  
  You will need write permissions here (e.g. run it as root). Unfortunately
  you will nee to re-run this after every upgrade.

What about plugins that depend on netrw? ~

This plugin defines `netrw#BrowseX()`  and `netrw#NetrwBrowseX()`. Plugins
that depend on it (such as fugitive.vim) should continue to work.

FUNCTIONS                                                 *xdg_open-functions*

xdg_open#open({source})                                        *xdg_open#open*

    Valid values for the {source} parameter:

    - 0: Use |expand()| on |g:xdg_open_match|.
    - 1: Use the last visual selection.
    - any other string: Use the string as-is.

xdg_open#open_url({source})                                *xdg_open#open_url*

    Like |xdg_open#open|, but displays an error if the input doesn't look like
    an URL.
